    <h2>Let's learn about honeybees</h2>
    <p>Honey bees, also known as “honeybees,” are a group of insect species in the genus Apis. These insects are
        eusocial,
        which means they form large, complex societies. They are best known for building hives to store honey, and it is
        common
        to farm them for this reason. While they are not the only bees that can produce honey, the only true “honeybees”
        are in
        the genus Apis. Read on to learn about the honey bee.</p>
    <h3>Description of the Honey Bee:</h3>
    <p>There are 7 different species of honey bees, and 44 different subspecies. Each species and subspecies has its own
        minute
        differences in appearance. However, all have the same basic anatomy.</p>
    <img src="Types of bees.jpg" alt="Honeybees Types" width="550">
    <br>
    <p>Their bodies consist of a head, thorax (or midsection), and abdomen (or rear section). The first section, the
        head,
        contains a pair of antennae, and mouthparts. Next, the thorax is where the wings and six legs, attach to the
        body.
        Finally, the famous stinger is at the end of the abdomen.</p>

    <h3>Interesting Facts About the Honey Bee:</h3>
    <p>Though people often fear these insects, particularly because some people are allergic to them, they are actually
        extremely important creatures. Honeybees are the chief pollinators of a number of plants. Learn more fun facts
        about
        honeybees below!</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Single-use:</b> Unlike wasps, honeybees can only sting once. When they insert the stinger, it pulls off
            part of the bee’s abdomen and
            digestive tract. This means that if a bee stings you, it will die. However, they can sting other insects
            without dying,
            as their barbed stingers don’t stick in thinner skin.</li><br> <img src="sting honeybees.jpg"

        <li><b>The Fruits of their Efforts:</b> Even though bees sting, that doesn’t mean they are bad insects.
            Actually, they are incredibly important in the
            production of fruits and vegetables, as well as the reproduction of plants. These insects are essential in
            the
            pollination of kiwi, watermelon, cantaloupe, squash, pumpkin, macadamia, cashew, and cucumber, just to name
            a few!</li><br> <img src="reproduction.webp" alt="Reproduction of honeybees" width="300" height="200">
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Perks of Pollination:</b> Plants and their pollinators have a mutualistic relationship. This means that
            both creatures benefit from the
            interaction. When bees drink the nectar of flowers, they also collect dust-like pollen on their legs. They
            then deposit
            the pollen onto other flowers they visit for nectar. Spreading pollen is essential in the reproductive
            system of plants.
            Basically, without bees, we wouldn’t have many types of fruits!</li><br> <img src="pollination.webp"

    <h3>Habitat of the Honey Bees:</h3>
    <p>These insects require habitats with plenty of feeding opportunities nearby, namely, flowering plants. They can
        live in
        natural habitats, agricultural areas, and urban parks or gardens. Their preferred habitats include orchards,
        meadows,
        gardens, woodlands, and virtually anywhere with plenty of flowers growing.</p>

    <p>Honey bees are also capable of surviving in cold climates, and thermoregulate by huddling within the nest. The
        bees
        actually shiver to increase the temperature inside the hive.</p>
